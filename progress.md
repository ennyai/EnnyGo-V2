## Development Workflow
### Branching Strategy
- Main Branch (main)
  - Contains stable, production-ready code
  - Protected from direct pushes
  - Requires pull request reviews

- Feature Branches (feature/*)
  - Created for each new feature
  - Examples:
    - feature/strava-auth
    - feature/dashboard
    - feature/virtual-events

- Fix Branches (fix/*)
  - Created for bug fixes
  - Examples:
    - fix/test-coverage
    - fix/loading-state
    - fix/auth-flow

- Test Branches (test/*)
  - Created for test implementations
  - Examples:
    - test/events-component
    - test/redux-store
    - test/integration

### Branch Workflow
1. Create new branch from main

# Progress Log

## Environment Variable Configuration Fixes (2024-02-15)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Supabase Environment Variables**
   - Fixed missing environment variables error in production
   - Improved error handling and logging for Supabase configuration
   - Added better debugging information for environment status

### Implementation Details
1. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Updated `src/lib/supabase.js` to handle missing configuration gracefully
   - Added detailed logging of environment and configuration status
   - Implemented a mock client for when configuration is missing

2. **Build Process**
   - Simplified Dockerfile to handle environment variables more cleanly
   - Removed duplicate environment variable definitions
   - Streamlined Railway configuration

3. **Railway Setup**
   - Cleaned up environment variable configuration in Railway
   - Removed complex variable references using `${{RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT}}`
   - Set environment variables directly in Railway dashboard

### Current Status
- Environment variables are properly configured for both build and runtime
- Supabase client provides better error messages when configuration is missing
- Build process is more reliable with simplified configuration

### Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment for any remaining environment-related issues
2. Test Supabase authentication and database operations
3. Verify proper environment variable handling across different deployment environments

### Technical Details
- Environment Variables Required:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://txqofphvxzrxbmlihyxg.supabase.co
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]
  ```
- Configuration Files Updated:
  - `src/lib/supabase.js`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `railway.toml`

### Notes
- Environment variables must be set directly in Railway without using variable references
- The build process now handles environment variables more reliably
- Added better error handling and user feedback for configuration issues

## [2025-01-29] - Environment Variable Hotfix
