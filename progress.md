## Notes
- All base components now use shadcn/ui for consistent styling
- Redux implementation complete for core features
- Modern UI components with responsive design
- Proper directory structure maintained
- Utils setup for component styling

## Next Steps Priority
1. Complete remaining shadcn/ui component implementation
2. Create dashboard layout and features
3. Implement authentication flow
4. Set up API integration
5. Add comprehensive testing

## Development Workflow
### Branching Strategy
- Main Branch (main)
  - Contains stable, production-ready code
  - Protected from direct pushes
  - Requires pull request reviews

- Feature Branches (feature/*)
  - Created for each new feature
  - Examples:
    - feature/strava-auth
    - feature/dashboard
    - feature/virtual-events

- Fix Branches (fix/*)
  - Created for bug fixes
  - Examples:
    - fix/test-coverage
    - fix/loading-state
    - fix/auth-flow

- Test Branches (test/*)
  - Created for test implementations
  - Examples:
    - test/events-component
    - test/redux-store
    - test/integration

### Branch Workflow
1. Create new branch from main
2. Develop and test feature
3. Create pull request
4. Code review
5. Merge to main
6. Delete feature branch

yarn test
```

## Important Notes
- Always use yarn for package management
- Check ERROR_SOLUTIONS.md for troubleshooting common issues
